## Current activities

During January 19th - May 2024, we will complete reading the new book [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham . See the [schedule
wiki](https://github.com/waldronlab/data-science-seminar/wiki) for the schedule of presentations.

## About us

This repository represents the joint effort of the
[City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and
Health Policy](http://sph.cuny.edu/). During active semesters we hold
weekly meetings, where a chapter of a book is presented by a
developing instructor with a focus on modern applied statistical
methodology and using the R language. Our meetings are open to all
(see details below), and materials we produce are licensed under the Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License. We
hope you find these materials useful and will join our sessions.

## Getting started

1. Leave a comment on the ["Welcome to the Advanced R Book Club" Issue](https://github.com/waldronlab/data-science-seminar/issues/12) to introduce yourself and to
let us know your GitHub username.

2. Join our Google Group (open membership) and sign up to receive
emails by visiting
https://groups.google.com/g/cuny-data-science-book-club.

3. Install R and RStudio following these
[instructions](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jutts/110/InstallingRandRStudio.pdf). Here
is a short video showing [how to use RStudio to contribute to this
Github repo](http://youtu.be/uHYcDQDbMY8).

4. Sign up for a GitHub account, then introduce yourself on the "Welcome to the Advanced R Book Club" issue of this repository, under [Issues](https://github.com/waldronlab/data-science-seminar/issues).  You will then be able to contribute your presentation and/or exercise notes using file upload directly here, or by using git. If you want to use git instead of simple file upload but don't know what that means, follow this
[tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). The process
in RStudio is documented
[here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)
or there is a video
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-managing-part-2/).



## Presenting

1. Pick the date or topic that best suits you and reserve it on the
[presentation schedule
wiki](https://github.com/waldronlab/data-science-seminar/wiki), adding
your GitHub username to the schedule table.

2. Read the required section of the book, and do the associated
exercises that you will present.

3. Edit the presentation file, using the template provided in the folder corresponding to the textbook name. See more information about making [Slidy presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/slidy-presentation.html). 

4. Commit the presentation to GitHub so that it is
available to others. Don't know what that means? The process is
documented
[here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)
or there is a video
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-managing-part-2/).
